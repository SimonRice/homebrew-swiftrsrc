This is a temporary Homebrew formula for [swiftrsrc](https://github.com/indragiek/swiftrsrc), which is copied over from a thus-far unmerged Homebrew fork by 'klaaspieter'.  I chose to create this repository while this formula is under approval. To install open up a terminal and type:

1. `brew tap simonrice/swiftrsrc` to add this repository to homebrew.
2. `brew install swiftrsrc` to install swiftrsrc.
